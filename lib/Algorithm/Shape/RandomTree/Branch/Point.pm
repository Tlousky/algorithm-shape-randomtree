=head1 NAME 

Algorithm::Shape::RandomTree::Branch::Point - Branch point - a 2D point on the
geometrical path representing a RandomTree's branch.

Meant to be used as part of the Algorithm::Shape::RandomTree module and
not really useful on it's own.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Create a point with (X,Y) coordinates of (1,3)

    my $branch_point = Algorithm::Shape::RandomTree::Branch::Point->new(
        x => 1,
        y => 3,
    );
